        Anime and anime reviews hold a significant place in the world of entertainment and storytelling. Anime is a diverse and captivating medium that spans various genres, from fantasy and science fiction to romance and drama, often exploring complex themes and characters. Anime reviews serve as valuable guides, helping fans and newcomers alike discover the best series and movies within this expansive world.

As an anime enthusiast, I am eager to embark on the journey of reviewing my five favorite anime series or movies. These selections have left a profound impact on me, each for its unique storytelling, character development, and visual artistry. Through my reviews, I aim to provide insights into the intricate narratives and emotional depth of these anime, while also sharing my personal connection with them. By doing so, I hope to contribute to the vibrant community of anime enthusiasts and encourage others to explore the rich and diverse world of Japanese animation.

            <li><a href="https://anilist.co/anime/1535/DEATH-NOTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Death Note </a></li>
            <p>This is simply the greatest anime I’ve ever watched. When it comes to anime I usually don’t watch much. But some how Death note breaks every regular anime trope and creates suspense and exciting new twists and turns in pretty much every episode, it forces you to pay attention and grasp what’s going on all the time. The two main characters rivalry is so spectacularly portrayed as a one on one even when the two are surrounded by other people the show some how manages to single them out as two great minds fighting against each other. Although it’s short being only one season long it has a reason for that, Death note doesn’t really need to be that long the one season some how satisfies you and raps up the story in a neat and fulfilling way. I quit literally watched it in about 3 days cause I couldn’t keep my eyes of it, I highly recommend this show to people who want to be entertained but personally I don’t think everyone will like it that’s just with every piece of media though but still at the very least out of the 37 episodes there are watch the first one or two to see if you get hooked.
